Day 1: Tip Calculator
---
We all know the struggles that come at the end of a delicious meal when dining out. Splitting the bill. Luckily for you and your poss√©, you're a brilliant developer that has finished Learning Ruby the Hard Way over the weekend and can create an application that allows you to split the bill, WITH TAX && TIP!

You can't wait to demonstrate your prowess and live up to your street name as `The Ruby Maestro`, so you bust out your brand new Macbook in the middle of a 3-star Michelin restaurant, open up Atom, and begin to code in your `main.rb`.

##The objectives
Your calculator will ask for 4 inputs:
1. The subtotal
2. # of people
3. Give an option of how much tip to leave
4. % tax

After you input these 3 in the calculator, the calculator should take those inputs into a mathematical calculation and give us the total and how much each person pays. 

The user flow and messages you send are completely up to you!

####For tips, let the user pick an option 1-4, and based on the number they pick, it runs and action after. (Hint: Use conditionals)
####Remember that tax and tip is based off the subtotal!
